## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As of August 26th, 2022, the Twitch Extension showcasing StarCraft II seasonal data is no longer available.

Source code of the project is still there for historical purposes.

Related open source projects that aren't marked as archived will be in limited maintenance mode, mostly for bug fixes and dependency updates. They will remain available for as long as Blizzard offers community APIs for their games.

You can read the project story here: https://www.offbeatbits.com/how-to-change-your-life-with-twitch-and-starcraft-vol-1/

Thank you for using the extension!
